# Growth

Growth in life is mesmerizing with the intricacies of the structures that are created. This programming poem series is an exploration of what happens with small incremental additions. Descriptions of my process and thoughts for each poem can be [found on my website](http://gregtatum.com/tag/growth/?order=ASC).
